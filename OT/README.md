Welcome to the Operational Technology (OT) Security section of the Blue Team Village @ DEFCON 31!


### OT: Why OT Cybersecurity Engineers Drink So Much
#### Description
A brief view into the odd world of Operational Technology (OT) and why so many OT Security Engineers drink like they hate themselves. This will cover the realities of their tech stack, business risk considerations, control systems recovery and how incident response is conducted within the environment. We will briefly cover how this environment was emulated for the Project Obsidian attack chain and how it differs from the physical environments.
