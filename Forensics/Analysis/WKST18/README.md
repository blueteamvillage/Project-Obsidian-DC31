# WKST18

WKST18 does not contain any evidence that is material to the compromise.  It was originally collected because it was believed to be impacted.  After further investigation it has been ruled out.  This sometimes happens in investigations, and shoutd be expected.  Nonetheless, a Triage report has been included. It consists of two files:

1. Collection-wkst18_magnumtempus_financial-2023-06-20T01_52_51Z.htm 
2. sortable-Ach.js

These two files can be downoaded to your machine to review the common Windows artifacts that are collected and analyzed in a triage.  The javascript file allows you to sort the tables in the HTML report by clicking on the column headings.  This is extrememly useful when narrowing the time windows in which the activity occured, and helps to weed out the noise that is not relevant to the investiation.  Both files should be put int the same directory. The triage report does not require any additional software or plugins, and should work with popular browsers.
