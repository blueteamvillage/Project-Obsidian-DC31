## About
The Blue Team Village is a community of Blue Teamers, Defense, and InfoSec professionals. We are a community of defenders, and our mission is to empower and enable defenders to learn and grow within the cyber defense field. We do this by providing a community driven approach to education, collaboration, and knowledge sharing.

## Village Content
The Blue Team Village will be hosting a variety of talks, workshops, and other events during DEFCON 31. Please visit the link below to view the full schedule of events: https://info.defcon.org/tag/?id=40282

### Talks
Talks are broken into two sections this year. The 101 track is for those new to the field, and the Kill Chain track covers the attack simulation we conducted during Project Obsidian. The talks are split into stations for each major area of cyber defense.
